1) vin_decode.ipynb  Intent is to use 'nhtsa' API to fetch VIN related metadata. (i.e., make, model, model year, manufacturer, plant etc)
                  High level skeleton code only. 

2) Logfile contains log message from IOT devices attached to cars as a JSON docs. Goal is processing those JSON messages and render.
